# Lesson 9: `if else` a.k.a control flow pt. 1
This is where the rubber hits the road, folks.\
Prior to this lesson our programs looked like a straight line.
```
  String myString = "Mr.Wallace";
  String newString = myString + " teaches Intro to CS";
  System.out.println(newString);
  
```
Each of these three lines will be run by the computer (unless I missed an error).\
We'll learn how to make more complex programs by adding new 'paths' to our code
